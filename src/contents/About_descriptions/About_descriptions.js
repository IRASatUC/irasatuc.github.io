    "The Intelligent Robotics and Autonomous Systems Laboratory (IRAS Lab) is a 3,500-square-foot research facility located on the University of Cincinnatiâ€™s main campus and in Digital Futures. It supports fundamental and applied research in intelligent and bio-inspired robotics, machine learning, multibody dynamics and control, and human-robot interaction and collaboration. These efforts are closely aligned with and directly support applications in space robotics and autonomy, including spacecraft rendezvous, proximity operations and docking (RPO-D), in-space/on-orbit servicing, assembly and manufacturing (ISAM/OSAM), and space logistics.",

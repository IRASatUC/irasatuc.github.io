Objective & Scope:  
Develop an one-stop solution for efficient 3D scanning of an aircraft for inspection or outer-mold-line (OML) model generation.

Motivation
Aircraft maintenance often needs accurate 3D OML models for detailed inspection, data record, or other process. Many aircraft either do not have a 3D model or have an inaccurate 3D model due to hardware deviation. Current technology requires weeks time to manually scan an entire aircraft, which is a process of high cost, low efficiency, and also low quality. Moreover, human visual inspection is prone to human errors and stress. 

New Technology
Uses the latest Artificial Intelligence (AI), Robotics, and Sensing technologies, we are developing a new solution:
UAV for coarse scan and UGV & robot-arm for detailed scan
AI calculates random and fully-covered marker distribution
AI helps generate optimal collision-free scan trajectories
Robot accurately places and removes the markers (if needed)
Robot performs smooth and accurate 3D scanning
AI and vision sensors perform real-time inspection & feedback
AI enhanced robot smartly performs repeated scanning for difficult spots as a skilled human worker does
AI enhanced 3D model generation and quality assessment
Studying the feasibility of using a UAV for detailed scanning

Advantages
Much faster and automated process, more accurate models, much less human labor, less dependent on human skills, transferable knowledge (AI software and trained models).

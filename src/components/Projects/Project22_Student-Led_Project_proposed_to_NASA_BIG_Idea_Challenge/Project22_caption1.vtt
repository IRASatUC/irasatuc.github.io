Andrew Barth:
Hello, we're students at the
University of Cincinnati,

00:04.000 --> 00:06.700 line:10 position:72%
Andrew Barth:
and we would like to
introduce you to the CableCat.

00:06.900 --> 00:10.600 line:10 position:72%
Andrew Barth:
Our big idea, for the exploration of the
lunar permanently shadowed regions,

00:10.600 --> 00:14.400 line:10 position:72%
Andrew Barth:
solves the problem of delivering power
to areas of limited or no sunlight.

00:14.700 --> 00:18.300 line:10 position:72%
Andrew Barth:
Once arriving at the PSR, our CableCat
will serve as a power hub

00:18.300 --> 00:22.600 line:10 position:72%
Andrew Barth:
for visiting vehicles to come and recharge
and continue their own science missions.

00:23.800 --> 00:27.500 line:10 position:70%
Caleb Bisig:
Hi, I'm Caleb Bisig, here to introduce
the key functionality of our robot.

00:27.600 --> 00:31.600 line:10 position:70%
Caleb Bisig:
So the design of our robot is a spool
with independently controlled wheels

00:31.600 --> 00:36.200 line:10 position:70%
Caleb Bisig:
capable of navigating around the lunar surface
while passively unspooling power cable.

00:36.600 --> 00:38.400 line:10 position:70%
Caleb Bisig:
This cable would be up to 100 meters long,

00:38.400 --> 00:42.600 line:10 position:70%
Caleb Bisig:
allowing our robot to bring power from the base
to anywhere the robot's capable of reaching.

00:43.500 --> 00:47.200 line:10 position:72%
Jacky Wang:
Hey, this is Jacky, and we are going to talk
about the mechanical design of this project.

00:47.700 --> 00:50.200 line:10 position:72%
Jacky Wang:
We have three different ways
to keep it from falling over.

00:50.900 --> 00:54.600 line:10 position:72%
Tom Wu:
Hi, I'm Tom. First of all, do you know
the structure of the segway?


00:54.600 --> 00:58.300 line:10 position:72%
Tom Wu:
It has a gyroscope and
it can achieve self-balance.

00:58.600 --> 01:04.300 line:10 position:72%
Jimmy Shan:
Hey, this is Jimmy. Secondly, I considered
elongating the length of the shaft

01:04.300 --> 01:08.600 line:10 position:72%
Jimmy Shan:
so that the stability of the robot will increase.

01:08.600 --> 01:15.000 line:10 position:72%
Neo Yang:
Hello, this is Neo. At last, we can put
hemispherical protection nets

01:15.000 --> 01:16.500 line:10 position:72%
Neo Yang:
on the side of the wheels.

01:16.500 --> 01:20.200 line:10 position:72%
Neo Yang:
It can protect the camera
and prevent it from rolling over.

01:20.700 --> 01:24.500 line:10 position:72%
Prithev Govindasamy Srinivasan:
Hi, my name is Prithev, and I am
working on stablization of the robot.

01:24.500 --> 01:27.400 line:10 position:72%
Prithev Govindasamy Srinivasan:
The camera sensors that [are] used
for navigation purposes

01:27.400 --> 01:32.200 line:10 position:72%
Prithev Govindasamy Srinivasan:
[are] attached to an extension
of the central hub of the robot

01:32.700 --> 01:35.800 line:10 position:72%
Prithev Govindasamy Srinivasan:
and the camera sensors are continuously
capturing the environment

01:35.800 --> 01:39.500 line:10 position:72%
Prithev Govindasamy Srinivasan:
and providing those data
to the onboard computer,

01:39.500 --> 01:42.300 line:10 position:72%
Prithev Govindasamy Srinivasan:
and for this purpose,
the robot has to be stable,

01:42.300 --> 01:44.300 line:10 position:72%
Prithev Govindasamy Srinivasan:
and we are planning to
achieve this stability

01:44.300 --> 01:48.800 line:10 position:72%
Prithev Govindasamy Srinivasan:
with the help of a ring-laser gyroscope
and the gimbal mechanism.

01:49.800 --> 01:54.800 line:10 position:72%
Aratrika Pan:
Hi, I'm Aratrika Pan, and I will be describing
some additional features of the CableCat.

01:55.400 --> 01:58.450 line:10 position:72%
Aratrika Pan:
The power ports are located
up the edge of the hemispherical frame

01:58.450 --> 02:01.800 line:10 position:72%
Aratrika Pan:
and provide an elevated charging station
for approaching vehicles.

02:02.200 --> 02:05.000 line:10 position:72%
Aratrika Pan:
The central hub contains
thermally sensitive electronics,

02:05.000 --> 02:08.600 line:10 position:72%
Aratrika Pan:
including the IMU, processor,
battery, and drive motors.

02:09.200 --> 02:11.700 line:10 position:72%
Aratrika Pan:
The battery will be used to augment
the power from the lander

02:11.700 --> 02:14.800 line:10 position:72%
Aratrika Pan:
in scenarios where maximum
drive and torque is required.

02:16.300 --> 02:19.100 line:10 position:74%
Michael Saxer:
Hello, my name is Michael Saxer
and we are designing our rover

02:19.100 --> 02:23.100 line:10 position:74%
Michael Saxer:
to survive the extreme highs and lows
of the lunar temperature environment,

02:23.300 --> 02:27.000 line:10 position:74%
Michael Saxer:
which includes the permanenty shadowed
regions which can get as low as 25 Kelvin.

02:28.200 --> 02:32.600 line:10 position:50%
Tim Hammer:
My name's Tim Hammer, we will be using
a lunar soil replicant to test our rover.

02:32.600 --> 02:37.600 line:10 position:50%
Tim Hammer:
As you can see here, we are expecting slopes
anywhere from 30 to 35 degrees max,

02:37.600 --> 02:39.400 line:10 position:50%
Tim Hammer:
we will be testing our rover with.

02:40.300 --> 02:43.800 line:10 position:74%
Michael Saxer:
We also plan on creating
a lunar sandbox to test our rover

02:43.800 --> 02:45.800 line:10 position:74%
Michael Saxer:
here at the University of Cincinnati.

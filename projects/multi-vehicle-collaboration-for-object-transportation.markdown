<h2 align="center"><b>Multi-Robot Cooperative Object Transportation</b></h2>

<h2 align="center">Problem Description</h2>
<p align="justify">
Multiple robots (as a team) jointly transport a large object to a targeted destination. 
</p>

<h2 align="center">Features and Methods</h2>
- No communication among robots.​
- No dynamics model nor path planning.​
- Decentralized and reinforcement learning based control.

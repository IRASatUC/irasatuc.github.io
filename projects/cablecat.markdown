|Student-Led Project proposed to NASA BIG Idea Challenge|![](/images/projects/cablecat/big_idea_icon.jpg)|

<h2 align="center"><b>CableCat: Powering the PSR</b></h2>

<h2 align="center">Objectives & Technical Approach</h2>
- Establish power infrastructure to the Permanently Shadowed Regions (PSRs) on the lunar surface of scientific interest.
- Enable new missions of science robots operating within a PSR by providing a power supply station to allow the robots be 100% self-sufficient.
- Develop an autonomous 2-wheeled spool (rover) to navigate into the desired a PSR, unspooling the power/data cable.
- Design the spool such that it guarantees always in right posture while traveling on uncertain terrain.

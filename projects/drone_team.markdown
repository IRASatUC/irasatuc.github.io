<h2 align="center"><b>Drone Team Collaboration as A Distributed System</b></h2>

<h2 align="center">Research Goal</h2>
<p align="justify">
Development of a decentralized system of collaborative UAVs that can jointly bring a large load from one place to another.
</p>

<h2 align="center">Strategic Alignment</h2>
<p align="justify">
Decentralized collaborative system of UAVs provide the ability to lift heavy loads while also simultaneously reducing the dependence on any individual UAV in the team.
</p>

<h2 align="center">Objectives</h2>
- Develop a physics based simulation environment for multi-UAV load-transportation system.
- Develop machine learning based controllers for each UAV with the goal of transporting the load, by working as a team.
- Extend the methodology to real-life control of multiple collaborative UAVs.

<h2 align="center">Approach</h2>
<p align="justify">
Apply Genetic Fuzzy Methodology (GFM) or Machine Learning (ML) techniques to train the system of UAVs to achieve the common goal of transporting a load to a target location. By penalizing undesirable actions, GA/ML can tune the controller parameters to ensure near-optimal performance by the UAV team.
</p>

<h2 align="center">Applications</h2>
- Lifting heavy objects in industrial and military missions.
- Agile communication and connection for fast responding natural disasters.
- Agile sensor networking for quick situation awareness.

<h2 align="center">State-of-the-art</h2>
<p align="justify">
UAV team activities are mostly limited to formation flights coordinated by a centralized controller which is vulnerable to security or reliability problems. An individual UAV's behavior can easily affect the performance of the entire team.

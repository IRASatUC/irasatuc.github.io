<h2 align="center"><b>UAV-Manipulator Systems for Aerial Manipulation</b></h2>

<h2 align="center">Research problems</h2>
- Coupling dynamics between UAV and arm
- Contact dynamics between arms and environment 
- Coordinated control of the UAV and arms
- Lightweight arm design and extra power demanding​
- Challenges on human operation​
- Challenge on safe and fully controlled testing​
- Uncertainties (e.g., wind, rain, dust, parts failures)​ 

<h2 align="center">Potential Applications</h2>
- Inspects and fix large or tall structures
- Perches on various spots like a bird
- Picks and places a payload
- Performs dexterous aerial manipulations
- Rescues operations after natural disasters
- Assembly and construction
- 3D printing large structures from air
